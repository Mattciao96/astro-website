swiperjs is a library to display swiping carusel
link: https://swiperjs.com/
unfortunately the react version is going to be deprecated soon
the official website says to use the web component version but on github there are a lot of issues
so i'm going to implement the core js version in 2 ways:
- vanilla js using astro components
- react built on top of the core js version
